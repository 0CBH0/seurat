\arguments{
\item{reference}{\code{\link{Seurat}} object to use as the reference}

\item{query}{\code{\link{Seurat}} object to use as the query}

\item{normalization.method}{Name of normalization method used: LogNormalize or SCT}

\item{reference.assay}{Name of the Assay to use from reference}

\item{query.assay}{Name of the Assay to use from query}

\item{reduction}{Dimensional reduction to perform when finding anchors. Options are:
\itemize{
   \item{pcaproject: Project the PCA from the reference onto the query. We recommend using PCA
   when reference and query datasets are from scRNA-seq}
   \item{cca: Run a CCA on the reference and query }
}}

\item{project.query}{Project the PCA from the query dataset onto the reference. Use only in rare
cases where the query dataset has a much larger cell number, but the reference dataset has a
unique assay for transfer.}

\item{features}{Features to use for dimensional reduction}

\item{npcs}{Number of PCs to compute on reference. If null, then use an existing PCA structure in
the reference object}

\item{l2.norm}{Perform L2 normalization on the cell embeddings after dimensional reduction}

\item{dims}{Which dimensions to use from the reduction to specify the neighbor search space}

\item{k.anchor}{How many neighbors (k) to use when finding anchors}

\item{k.filter}{How many neighbors (k) to use when filtering anchors}

\item{k.score}{How many neighbors (k) to use when scoring anchors}

\item{max.features}{The maximum number of features to use when specifying the neighborhood search
space in the anchor filtering}

\item{nn.method}{Method for nearest neighbor finding. Options include: rann,
annoy}

\item{eps}{Error bound on the neighbor finding algorithm (from \code{\link{RANN}})}

\item{approx.pca}{Use truncated singular value decomposition to approximate PCA}

\item{verbose}{Print progress bars and output}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{\link{AnchorSet}} object
}
\description{
Find a set of anchors between a reference and query object. These 
anchors can later be used to transfer data from the reference to 
query object using the \code{\link{TransferData}} object.
