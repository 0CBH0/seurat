\arguments{
\item{object}{An object}

\item{mean.function}{Function to compute x-axis value (average expression). Default
is to take the mean of the detected (i.e. non-zero) values}

\item{dispersion.function}{Function to compute y-axis value (dispersion). Default is to
take the standard deviation of all values}

\item{num.bin}{Total number of bins to use in the scaled analysis (default
is 20)}

\item{binning.method}{Specifies how the bins should be computed. Available methods are:
\itemize{
  \item{equal_width:}{ each bin is of equal width along the x-axis [default]}
  \item{equal_frequency:}{ each bin contains an equal number of features (can increase
statistical power to detect overdispersed features at high expression values, at
the cost of reduced resolution along the x-axis)}
}}

\item{num.features}{Number of top variable features to get}

\item{mean.cutoff}{Cutoff for feature means, must be a two-length numeric for low and high values}

\item{dispersion.cutoff}{Cutoff for feature dispersion values, must be a two-length numeric for low and high values}

\item{selection.method}{Specifies how to select the features to store in the object
\itemize{
  \item{mean.var.plot: }{Default method, placing cutoffs on the mean variablility plot}
  \item{dispersion: }{Choose the top.features with the highest dispersion}
}}

\item{display.progress}{show progress bar for calculations}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods}

\item{assay.use}{...}
}
\description{
Identifies features that are outliers on a 'mean variability plot'. First, uses
a function to calculate average expression (mean.function) and dispersion (dispersion.function)
for each feature. Next, divides features into num.bin (deafult 20) bins based on
their average expression, and calculates z-scores for dispersion within each
bin. The purpose of this is to identify variable features while controlling for
the strong relationship between variability and average expression.
}
\details{
Exact parameter settings may vary empirically from dataset to dataset, and
based on visual inspection of the plot.
Setting the y.cutoff parameter to 2 identifies features that are more than two standard
deviations away from the average dispersion within a bin. The default X-axis function
is the mean expression level, and for Y-axis it is the log(Variance/mean). All mean/variance
calculations are not performed in log-space, but the results are reported in log-space -
see relevant functions for exact details.
