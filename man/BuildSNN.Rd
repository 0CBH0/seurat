\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{distance.matrix}{Boolean value of whether the provided matrix is a
distance matrix}

\item{k.param}{Defines k for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm}

\item{prune.SNN}{Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard index when
computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction. Any edges with
values less than or equal to this will be set to 0 and removed from the SNN
graph. Essentially sets the strigency of pruning (0 --- no pruning, 1 ---
prune everything).}

\item{nn.eps}{Error bound when performing nearest neighbor seach using RANN;
default of 0.0 implies exact nearest neighbor search}

\item{verbose}{Whether or not to print output to the console}

\item{force.recalc}{Force recalculation of SNN.}

\item{features.use}{A vector of feature names to use in construction of SNN
graph if building directly based on data rather than a dimensionally reduced
representation (i.e. PCs).}

\item{assay.use}{Assay to use in construction of SNN}

\item{reduction.use}{Name of dimensional reduction technique to use in
construction of SNN graph. (e.g. "pca", "ica")}

\item{dims.use}{A vector of the dimensions to use in construction of the SNN
graph (e.g. To use the first 10 PCs, pass 1:10)}

\item{do.plot}{Plot SNN graph on tSNE coordinates}

\item{graph.name}{Optional naming parameter for stored SNN graph. Default is
assay.name_snn.}

\item{features.use}{Features to use as input for building the SNN}

\item{reduction.use}{Reduction to use as input for building the SNN}

\item{dims.use}{Dimensions of reduction to use as input}
}
\value{
Returns the object with object@snn filled

\description{
Constructs a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph for a given dataset. We
first determine the k-nearest neighbors of each cell. We use this knn graph
to construct the SNN graph by calculating the neighborhood overlap
(Jaccard index) between every cell and its k.param nearest neighbors.
