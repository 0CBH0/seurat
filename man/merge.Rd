\usage{
merge(x, y, ...)

\method{merge}{Seurat}(x = NULL, y = NULL, add.cell.ids = NULL,
  merge.data = TRUE, project = "SeuratProject", min.cells = 0,
  min.features = 0)

\method{merge}{Assay}(x = NULL, y = NULL, add.cell.ids = NULL,
  min.cells = 0, min.features = 0, merge.data = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object}

\item{y}{Object (or a list of multiple objects)}

\item{add.cell.ids}{A character vector of length(x = c(x, y)). Appends the
corresponding values to the start of each objects' cell names.}

\item{merge.data}{Merge the data slots instead of just merging the raw.data
(which requires renormalization). This is recommended if the same normalization
approach was applied to all objects.}

\item{project}{Sets the project name for the Seurat object.}

\item{min.cells}{Include features detected in at least this many cells. Will subset the raw.data
matrix as well. To reintroduce excluded features, create a new object with a lower cutoff.}

\item{min.features}{Include cells where at least this many features are detected.}
}
\value{
Merged object
}
\description{
Merge two or more objects.
}
\details{
When merging Seurat objects, the merge procedure will merge the Assay level
raw data and potentially the data slots (depending on the merge.data parameter).
It will also merge the cell-level meta data that was stored with each object
and preserve the cell identities that were active in the objects pre-merge.
The merge will not preserve reductions, graphs or logged commands that were
present in the original objects.
