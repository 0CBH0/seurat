\title{Gene expression markers of identity classes defined by a phylogenetic clade}
\usage{
FindMarkersNode(object, node, tree.use = NULL, genes.use = NULL,
  logfc.threshold = 0.25, test.use = "wilcox", assay.type = "RNA",
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{node}{The node in the phylogenetic tree to use as a branch point}

\item{tree.use}{Can optionally pass the tree to be used. Default uses the tree in object@cluster.tree}

\item{logfc.threshold}{Limit testing to genes which show, on average, at least
X-fold difference (log-scale) between the two groups of cells. Default is 0.25
Increasing logfc.threshold speeds up the function, but can miss weaker signals.}

\item{test.use}{Denotes which test to use. Available options are:
\itemize{
 \item{"wilcox"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
 groups of cells using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (default)
 \item{"bimod"} : Likelihood-ratio test for single cell gene expression,
 (McDavid et al., Bioinformatics, 2013)
 \item{"roc"} : Identifies 'markers' of gene expression using ROC analysis.
 For each gene, evaluates (using AUC) a classifier built on that gene alone,
 to classify between two groups of cells. An AUC value of 1 means that
 expression values for this gene alone can perfectly classify the two
 groupings (i.e. Each of the cells in cells.1 exhibit a higher level than
 each of the cells in cells.2). An AUC value of 0 also means there is perfect
 classification, but in the other direction. A value of 0.5 implies that
 the gene has no predictive power to classify the two groups. Returns a
 'predictive power' (abs(AUC-0.5)) ranked matrix of putative differentially
 expressed genes.
 \item{"t"} : Identify differentially expressed genes between two groups of
 cells using the Student's t-test.
 \item{"tobit"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
 groups of cells using Tobit models, as proposed in Trapnell et al.,
 Nature Biotechnology, 2014
 \item{"negbinom"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
  groups of cells using a negative binomial generalized linear model.
  Use only for UMI-based datasets
 \item{"poisson"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
  groups of cells using a poisson generalized linear model.
  Use only for UMI-based datasets
 \item{"MAST} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two groups
 of cells using a hurdle model tailored to scRNA-seq data. Utilizes the MAST
 package to run the DE testing.
 \item{"DESeq2} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two groups
 of cells based on a model using DESeq2 which uses a negative binomial
 distribution (Love et al, Genome Biology, 2014).This test does not support
 pre-filtering of genes based on average difference (or percent detection rate)
 between cell groups. However, genes may be pre-filtered based on their
 minimum detection rate (min.pct) across both cell groups. To use this method,
 please install DESeq2, using the instructions at
 https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html

}
\value{
Matrix containing a ranked list of putative markers, and associated
statistics (p-values, ROC score, etc.)
}
\description{
Finds markers (differentially expressed genes) based on a branching point (node) in
the phylogenetic tree. Markers that define clusters in the left branch are positive markers.
Markers that define the right branch are negative markers.
